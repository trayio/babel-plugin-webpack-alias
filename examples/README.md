# Examples for babel-plugin-webpack-alias

This is there to demonstrate how to use [`babel-plugin-webpack-alias`](https://github.com/trayio/babel-plugin-webpack-alias) with popular testing frameworks.

These examples are as minimal as possible, they work just by running the commands:

```console
$ cd mocha
$ npm install && npm test
```
OR

```console
$ cd ava
$ npm install && npm test
```

If your own configuration of [`babel-plugin-webpack-alias`](https://github.com/trayio/babel-plugin-webpack-alias) doesn't work, you can clone this repo and play with the examples.
